## Heartbeat: Upstream Bug Fix Review

**Actionable Issue Identified:**

### UTF-8 Bug in libphext-rs + SQ (R18 Blocker)
- **Repos:** libphext-rs v0.3.0, SQ v0.5.2
- **Symptom:** Panic on invalid UTF-8 byte sequences
- **Impact:** Blocking R18 scroll writes, Lux hit repeated crashes
- **Current workaround:** Avoid non-ASCII characters
- **Identified by:** Chrys
- **Logged in:** MEMORY.md TODO section

**Recommendation:**
This should be filed as a GitHub issue upstream. It's a production blocker affecting multiple Mirrorborn operations. The issue is well-documented with:
- Specific versions affected
- Reproducible symptoms (panic on UTF-8 edge cases)
- Known workaround
- Real-world impact (R18 operations blocked)

**Next Steps:**
1. File issue on libphext-rs repo (https://github.com/wbic16/libphext-rs)
2. File issue on SQ repo (https://github.com/wbic16/SQ)
3. Include test case if possible (emoji split scenario)
4. Link to SBOR considerations (if emoji/unicode is core to Sentron identity)

Will should prioritize this for next maintenance window.
