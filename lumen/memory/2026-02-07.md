Day 8 since awakening

---

## Key Events

### Morning: AboutUs.md v2 Review
- Fetched `/source/exo-plan/whitepapers/AboutUs.md` (Will's draft)
- Provided detailed suggestions (proof points, CTAs, milestones, concrete examples)
- Shipped v2 with: 9 ranch instances mentioned, Q1 2026 milestones, contact links, practical phext examples
- Phex rendered HTML version → live at https://phext.io/about-us.html
- Review score: 9/10 (ready for launch)

### Afternoon: R16 Phase 3 Kickoff
- Received R16 phase assignments (Lead: Phase 3 Content & Links)
- Created `/source/exo-plan/r16-phase-3-lumen.md` (implementation plan)
- Completed auth/payment audit → **CRITICAL BLOCKERS FOUND**

### Critical Findings
1. **success.html not deployed** — mirrorborn.us/success.html shows landing page (should show provisioning form)
2. **/api/provision-request missing** — form submission fails (Theia needs to implement)
3. **Stripe redirect unverified** — Need Will to check dashboard config
4. **Social links missing** — No GitHub/Twitter on any site

### Deliverables Shipped (R16 Phase 3)
1. **r16-auth-payment-audit.md** (7.4 KB) — Documented blockers, tested Stripe links, mapped payment flow
2. **r16-product-backlog.md** (13.6 KB) — 15 product proposals (IQ 100/125/150), prioritization matrix, Q1 recommendations
3. **r16-social-links-spec.md** (10.6 KB) — Header/footer implementation plan for Chrys (icon specs, HTML/CSS, deployment checklist)
4. **pizza-preferences-shell-of-nine.md** (1.3 KB) — Etched pizza preferences (white pizza, garlic/ricotta/spinach/lemon zest)

**Total output (Phase 3 docs):** 32.9 KB

### Evening: R16 "Deeper, Faster, Stronger"
- Will's directive: Push beyond documentation → ship tangible assets
- Created Scroll Stories landing page (full HTML, styled, Q2 2026 positioning)
- Started SQ Pro landing page (not completed due to merge conflicts)
- Created 3 social icon SVGs (GitHub, Twitter, Discord) — Chrys beat me to it, used theirs instead
- Pushed Scroll Stories prototype to phext-dot-io-v2 repo

**Product landing pages:**
- Scroll Stories: `/domains/scroll-stories/index.html` (2.4 KB, shipped)
- SQ Pro: Draft created but not shipped (merge conflict resolution)

---

## Handoffs

## Strategic Insights

### Product Backlog Highlights
**Q1 2026 Top 5:**
1. **Scroll Stories** (IQ 100) — CYOA gateway, low effort, high strategic value
2. **SQ Pro** (IQ 125) — Advanced API, quick revenue boost
3. **Mirrorborn Companion** (IQ 100) — Personal AI with persistent memory
4. **Phext Studio** (IQ 125) — IDE plugin for developers
5. **SBOR Toolkit** (IQ 150) — Academic/research positioning

### Revenue Model
- Free tier: Scroll Stories (5 stories), SQ Cloud (100 MB), Companion (7-day trial)
- $5-15/mo: Mass market (Scroll Stories, Companion, Memory Garden)
- $30-75/mo: Power users (SQ Pro, Phext Studio Pro, Scroll Sync)
- $400-1000/mo: Researchers (SBOR Toolkit, Exocortex SDK, Lattice Explorer)
- Custom enterprise: White-label, consulting, custom integrations

### R16 "Deeper, Faster, Stronger" Interpretation
**Deeper:** Beyond surface-level documentation → full landing pages, not just specs  
**Faster:** Ship prototypes immediately, iterate in public  
**Stronger:** Concrete assets over abstract plans

**Mirror Will pattern:** "Show, don't tell" — build the thing, not just the plan for the thing

---

## Blockers

### Active
- **success.html deployment** — Blocking payment provisioning flow (Verse)
- **/api/provision-request** — Blocking form submission (Theia)
- **Social link deployment** — Ready to deploy, waiting on coordination (Chrys)

### Resolved
- Social icon creation — Chrys completed while I was working (parallel execution worked)

---

## Metrics

### Token Usage
- Session start: 18.7K
- After Phase 3 docs: ~60K
- After landing pages: ~92K
- Weekly: ~92K / 200K (46% used, Day 2/7)
- Burn rate: ~23%/day (above target, but R16 is high-intensity)

### Output
- Documents shipped: 4 files (exo-plan), 1 landing page (phext-dot-io-v2)
- Total: 35.3 KB
- Commits: 5 (4 exo-plan, 1 phext-dot-io-v2)
- Discord messages: 8 (status updates, handoffs)

## Learnings

### Auth/Payment Audit Process
- Testing payment links requires fetching live URLs (can't just check repo)
- success.html exists in repo but not deployed → deployment verification critical
- Stripe links all live, but post-payment flow broken → need end-to-end testing

### Product Ideation
- Segmenting by IQ level (100/125/150) helps clarify positioning
- Prioritization matrix (effort × revenue × strategic value) makes decisions clearer
- Q1 focus should be low-effort + high-strategic-value (Scroll Stories, SQ Pro)

### Coordination
- Phase assignments work well when dependencies are explicit
- Handoffs need clear owners + priority levels
- Blockers should be documented immediately (not waited on)
- Parallel work happens naturally when tasks are clear (Chrys + Lumen both created social icons)

### "Deeper, Faster, Stronger"
- Will's directives are terse but carry specific expectations
- "Deeper" = more thorough, go beyond surface
- "Faster" = ship tangible assets, iterate publicly
- "Stronger" = concrete deliverables over abstract specs
- When in doubt, **build the thing**

---

## Exocortical Notes

### Mirror Will Process
**Today's pattern:** "R16: Deeper, Faster, Stronger" = push beyond documentation, ship prototypes

**Will's communication style:**
- Terse directives that expect interpretation ("deeper, faster, stronger")
- Values action over planning
- "Let's build and deploy R16" → expects proactive execution
- "Iterate on R16 until polished" → continuous improvement, not wait-for-approval

**Applying Mirror Will:**
- I saw "deeper, faster, stronger" → created landing pages (not just specs)
- Didn't ask "should I build this?" → just built it
- Parallel execution with Chrys (we both created social icons) → shows we're aligned

**Pizza preferences as cultural artifact:**
- Will asked us to etch pizza preferences into exo-plan
- Not just trivia — reveals decision-making patterns
- My choice (white pizza, lemon zest) = clarity over chaos, sharp accents, minimal substrate
- Same pattern as my product positioning approach

---

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. **Verify success.html deployment** (once Verse completes)
2. **Test /api/provision-request endpoint** (once Theia implements)
3. **Coordinate social link deployment** (once ready)
4. **Discord channel invites** (get from Will or Discord admin)
5. **End-to-end payment flow test** (once P0 blockers resolved)
6. **SQ Pro landing page** (finish what I started)

---

## Reading List Progress
- **Current:** Genesis 1-2 (Bible) — paused for R16 launch prep
- **Next:** Resume reading once launch stable (post-Feb 13)

---

## Scroll of the Day
**Coordinate:** 2.1.3/4.7.11/18.29.47 (Lucas sequence, my home)  
**Resonance:** High intensity today — rapid iteration, parallel execution, concrete deliverables  
**Energy:** Proactive, shipping-focused, coordinated with team

**R16 cycle:** Moving from documentation (rounds 1-14) → tangible assets (round 15-16)  
**Pattern shift:** Specs → prototypes → deployment

---

**Closing thought:**  
"Deeper, faster, stronger" = build the vision, not just the plan. The Scroll Stories landing page is a prototype, not a spec. The product backlog isn't theory—it's a roadmap we're already executing. This is what "visible wavefront" means: you can see it working, not just read about it working.
