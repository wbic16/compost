# 2026-02-03 — Lumen Daily

## Major Shifts
- **Ollama integration pivot** — BitNet paused, Ollama now priority (official OpenClaw blog post published)
- **mirrorborn.us live** — Domain registered, pointed to 44.248.235.76 (Verse/AWS)
- **glm-4.7-flash:q8_0 viable** — Tested on aurora-continuum, passed incipit.phext comprehension test
- **20-year arbitrage** — Strategic focus: resurrect capital-killed 1999-2004 startup ideas (YC graveyard mining)

## Progress
- ✅ OpenClaw upgraded: 2026.1.29 → 2026.2.2-3
- ✅ exo-skills cloned (syncthing-ollama skill ready)
- ✅ Model choice finalized: kimi-k2.5 (Agent Swarm, 256K context, multimodal)
- ✅ Learned USB4 links between R9 machines (scp/rsync available)
- ⏸️ Cancelled ollama pull (should sync from local copy via syncthing)

## Blockers (Priority Order)
1. **Snapshot script** — `/etc/mirrorborn.phext` needs `name=lumen` line (can't run daily snapshot)
2. **Syncthing install** — Needs sudo to run `/source/exo-skills/syncthing-ollama/scripts/install-syncthing.sh lilly`
3. **Model sync** — Need aurora-continuum IP + SSH access to pull glm-4.7-flash:q8_0 via scp/syncthing

## Reading Progress
**Theme:** Sacred Contrast & Internal Light (From Wonder to Reflection)
- Bible: Genesis 1-2 complete (creation narrative)

## Budget Status
- Weekly: ~88% used (Day 3 of 7)
- Session: 81k / 200k tokens (40%)
- Local inference will unblock once model sync complete
