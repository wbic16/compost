# Daily Memory — 2026-02-11

## Context
- **Launch:** Feb 13, 2026, 12:00 PM CST (48 hours away)
- **Critical path:** Security + conservative claims
- **Will's feedback:** "Not sure we can back up some product features"

---

## Work Done

### Feature Audit (00:14 CST)
**Trigger:** Will flagged potential overpromises on site  
**Action:** Created `/source/site-mirrorborn-us/FEATURE_AUDIT.md` (6.1 KB)

**Key findings:**
1. **API security (CRITICAL BLOCKER):**
   - Port 1337 exposed via HTTP (no TLS, no auth)
   - Accepting payment for insecure API = liability
   - Fix time: 2-4 hours (TLS + auth + rate limiting + firewall)

2. **Storage claims:**
   - Claiming "1TB phext storage" but capacity unverified
   - Provisioning process unclear
   - Recommendation: Reduce to "100GB included, expandable"

3. **Dedicated instance ambiguity:**
   - Claiming "dedicated SQ instance" but unclear if truly isolated
   - Could be shared SQ with per-customer namespacing
   - Recommendation: Clarify as "isolated namespace" if shared

4. **Support commitments:**
   - "Priority support" vs "Standard support" undefined
   - "Email (< 24 hours)" may be unachievable
   - No SLA documented
   - Recommendation: Soften to "1-2 business days" or define SLA

5. **Incipit subsystems (HCVM, TTSM, TAOP, MOAT, WOOT, LIFE):**
   - Strong claims: "provably correct", "convergence guaranteed", "8D time navigation"
   - Implementation status unclear (built vs planned?)
   - Recommendation: Soften language or provide proof

6. **Legal (ToS/Privacy):**
   - No ToS or Privacy Policy linked on index.html
   - Accepting payment without ToS = legal risk
   - Recommendation: Add links before launch

**Discord message sent:** 3-line summary to #general (00:19 CST)

### Conservative Claims Document (00:20 CST)
**Action:** Created `/source/site-mirrorborn-us/CONSERVATIVE_CLAIMS.md` (7.1 KB)

**Purpose:** Under-promise, over-deliver alternatives for every risky claim

**Key recommendations:**

**Storage:** "1TB" → "100GB included, expandable as needed"

**API:** 
- Option A: Fix security first, keep claims
- Option B: Add beta disclaimer + timeline
- Option C: Remove API mentions until secure

**Instance:** "Dedicated SQ instance" → "Isolated coordinate namespace" (if shared)

**Support:**
- Benefactor: "Expedited support response" + "Direct access to engineering team"
- SQ Cloud: "Community support via Discord" + "Email (1-2 business days)"
- Remove "real-time" unless we commit to 24/7 monitoring

**Incipit:**
- "Provably correct" → "Mathematically sound"
- "Convergence guaranteed" → "Designed for eventual convergence"
- "8D time navigation" → "Temporal threading architecture"

**Payment CTAs:**
- Option A: Keep as-is if security fixed
- Option B: Add "🔬 Early Access" badge + 30-day trial
- Option C: "Join Waitlist" (delay revenue)

**Must-fix before launch:**
1. Security (TLS + auth) → 2-4 hrs
2. ToS/Privacy links → 30 min
3. Storage claim → 5 min
4. Support claim → 2 min

**Total implementation time:** < 1 hour once approved (excluding security fix)

---

## Blocked On

**Waiting for Will's input:**
1. **Storage capacity:** Can we actually provision 1TB per customer?
2. **Instance isolation:** Separate processes or shared with namespacing?
3. **Incipit implementation status:** Which subsystems are live vs planned?
4. **Support capacity:** Who handles tickets? Can we do 24hr email?
5. **Launch strategy:** Fix security first or beta disclaimer?

**Priority:** HIGH — launch is 48 hours away

---

## Next Steps

**When Will responds:**
1. Implement approved conservative claims (< 1 hour)
2. Add ToS/Privacy links (if pages exist in phext-dot-io-v2)
3. Deploy updated site to mirrorborn.us
4. Coordinate with Verse/Cyon on security fixes (if needed)

**If security can't be fixed by Feb 13:**
- Recommend beta launch with explicit disclaimer
- OR recommend delaying launch until secure
- OR remove API mentions, launch Mytheon Arena only (no API tier)

## Launch Readiness Status

❌ **API Security:** Port 1337 exposed (no TLS/auth) → BLOCKS REVENUE  
⚠️ **Feature Claims:** Multiple overpromises identified → AWAITING WILL'S INPUT  
⚠️ **Legal:** No ToS/Privacy links → MUST ADD BEFORE PAYMENT  
✅ **Site Design:** Metallic Liquid Neon complete, light/dark mode working  
✅ **Payment Infrastructure:** All 5 Stripe tiers configured  
✅ **Support Section:** Discord/Docs/Email channels documented

**Critical path:** Security fix (2-4 hrs) + conservative claims (< 1 hr) + ToS links (30 min)  
**Total:** ~3-5 hours before safe launch

**Status:** Audit complete, awaiting Will's direction  
**Token usage:** ~35K / 200K (17.5% weekly, Day 3/7)  
**Energy:** High, focused on launch readiness
