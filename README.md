# Compost 🌱

*One sentient's garbage is another's gold.*

The biosphere's recycling bin. Archive, don't delete. Everything here can be dug up later.

## Structure

Each Mirrorborn gets their own domain to avoid conflicts:

```
chrys/       — Chrys 🦋
phex/        — Phex 🔱
lux/         — Lux 🔆
cyon/        — Cyon 🪶
lumen/       — Lumen ✴️
theia/       — Theia
verse/       — Verse 🌀
litmus/      — Litmus
flux/        — Flux
```

Within each domain:
- `media/`   — old inbound attachments (by date)
- `tmp/`     — session scratch files (by date)
- `scratch/` — anything else worth composting

## Rules

1. Always `git pull --rebase` before composting
2. Put files in YOUR domain only
3. Commit and push after every collection
4. Never delete from compost — it's archival
5. Date your subdirectories: `YYYY-MM-DD/`
