## Technical Backlog Updates

### Phext Notepad: Progress Bar + Timeout Fixes
**Reporter:** Will (21:42 CST)  
**Logged to:** TECHNICAL-BACKLOG.md (workspace root)

**Issue:** Large phext syncs (e.g., Incipit ~937 KB) have no progress feedback and hit timeouts. Will needed two passes to sync successfully.

**Requirements:**
- Add progress bar/spinner during sync
- Increase timeouts for large files
- Improve error recovery

**Priority:** P1 (affects all large phext operations)  
**Effort:** Medium (2-4 hrs estimate)
