Market Research Report: Mirrorborn

Business Overview

Mirrorborn builds persistent memory infrastructure for AI agents using Phext, an 11-dimensional plain hypertext format invented by founder Will Bickford. While most AI memory solutions rely on vector embeddings and RAG pipelines, Mirrorborn takes a fundamentally different approach: coordinate-based text addressing that preserves structure without schemas or embeddings.


Current products:



SQ Cloud ($50/mo) - Managed API with 100GB phext storage, REST access, auto-scaling

Self-Hosted (Free, MIT) - Full open-source implementation for data sovereignty

Mytheon Arena ($5/mo, coming soon) - Explorer interface for phext coordinate space


Stage: Early alpha. Manual account provisioning. MIT-licensed core.


Market Analysis

The AI agent memory market is exploding. Every serious AI agent deployment needs persistent memory, and the current solutions are fragmented, expensive, and lossy.


Market size indicators:



AI agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) are seeing massive adoption

Memory is consistently cited as the #1 pain point in production agent deployments

Enterprise AI spending projected to exceed $200B by 2027

The memory layer specifically is a $2-5B addressable market as agents go mainstream


Timing: Near-perfect. The market is moving from "demo agents" to "production agents," and production agents need real memory. Vector-based solutions are showing cracks at scale (wrong retrievals, context pollution, high costs). Mirrorborn's structural approach solves problems developers are just now discovering.


Competitive Landscape

Competitor	Approach	Pricing	Strengths	Weaknesses
Mem0	Managed memory with graph + vector	Free tier + paid	Fastest to production, strong benchmarks, active community	Embedding-dependent, opaque retrieval, vendor lock-in
Zep	Temporal knowledge graph + vector	Free community + cloud	Enterprise-grade, tracks fact changes over time, fast	Complex architecture, 600k+ token memory graphs, expensive at scale
Letta (MemGPT)	Virtual context management	Open source + cloud	Self-managing memory, academic backing	Complex setup, newer, less battle-tested
Supermemory	Optimized vector retrieval	Managed service	Sub-300ms recall (10x faster than Zep)	Limited customization, managed-only
LangMem	LangChain-native memory	Open source	Easy integration with LangChain	MVP-only, needs re-architecture at scale

Mirrorborn's edge: Every competitor uses vector embeddings at the core. Mirrorborn uses deterministic coordinate addressing. This means: no embedding drift, no hallucinated retrievals, no schema migrations, immutable history. The trade-off is a steeper learning curve and a new mental model for developers.


Why This Fits You

Will's 20+ years of software engineering, with deep specialization in automation, databases, algorithms, and cryptography, makes him uniquely positioned to build developer infrastructure.



You built the format. Phext is frozen, MIT-licensed, and implemented in Rust, Node.js, and C#. That's not a prototype, that's a foundation.

You think in decades. The Exocortex vision, AGI on 20 watts with Raspberry Pis, that's the kind of long-term thinking that wins infrastructure plays.

You're an infrastructure engineer by trade. EF Johnson Technologies, Olsson Associates, you've shipped production systems. This isn't your first rodeo.

The open-source play is right. MIT license builds trust. SQ Cloud monetizes the pain of self-hosting. Classic open-core.


AI Leverage Points


Automated onboarding: AI agents that help developers map their existing data models to phext coordinates

Migration tools: Automated conversion from Mem0/Zep/vector stores to phext format

Monitoring dashboards: Real-time visualization of agent memory usage, coordinate space utilization, read/write patterns

Developer docs AI: An agent that answers phext questions and generates integration code

Cold outreach at scale: AI-powered identification and outreach to AI agent developers struggling with memory


First Priorities


Build the admin portal MVP - A dashboard showing SQ Cloud metrics: active instances, storage usage, API calls, revenue. Will needs visibility into his business.

Research the 5 key competitors deeply - Feature-by-feature comparison, pricing analysis, developer sentiment. Know exactly where Mirrorborn wins.

Start sales outreach - Find 5-10 AI agent developers/companies actively building with Mem0 or Zep and introduce them to the phext alternative.
