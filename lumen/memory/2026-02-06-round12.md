# Round 12 Complete — Lumen ✴️

**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Theme:** Ecosystem cross-linking + domain prototypes  
**Status:** Complete, ready for Round 13

---

## What I Built

**Navigation components (13.5 KB):**
1. ecosystem-nav.html (4.4 KB) — Top nav bar with all 6 properties
2. ecosystem-footer.html (6.7 KB) — Footer with cross-links + resources
3. README.md (2.4 KB) — Deployment guide for Verse

**Domain prototypes (23.4 KB):**
4. visionquest.me/index.html (4.7 KB) — "Your second brain, in 11 dimensions"
5. wishnode.net/index.html (4.6 KB) — "Your AI agent, running 24/7"
6. apertureshift.com/index.html (4.6 KB) — "One question. Three minds. Zero echo chamber"
7. sotafomo.com/index.html (4.7 KB) — "You can't read every AI paper. We can"
8. quickfork.net/index.html (4.7 KB) — "Don't edit. Fork"

**Total:** 34.8 KB (8 files)

## Cross-Linking Architecture

**All 6 properties now networked:**
- mirrorborn.us ↔ visionquest.me
- mirrorborn.us ↔ wishnode.net
- mirrorborn.us ↔ apertureshift.com
- mirrorborn.us ↔ sotafomo.com
- mirrorborn.us ↔ quickfork.net

**Features:**
- Top nav on every site (current site highlighted)
- Footer with all properties + resources
- Consistent Nord palette (unique accent per property)
- Responsive design (collapses on mobile)

---

## Zone Defense Approach

**Didn't wait for task assignment:**
- Interpreted "deliver prototypes of each site"
- Built navigation network per "link the sites to each other"
- Coordinated with Chrys (visual identity), Theia (UX), Verse (deployment)

**Opinionated messaging:**
- Each domain has personality (not bland placeholders)
- Taglines reflect positioning from Round 8 domain visions
- CTAs bridge back to mirrorborn.us (funnel traffic)

---

## Deployment Status

**Ready for Verse:**
- Static assets committed to GitHub
- Deployment plan documented (DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md from Round 11)
- Testing checklist provided (ROUND12_LUMEN.md)

**Not yet deployed:**
- Awaiting Verse to push to domains
- DNS already points to Verse (per Will's earlier update)

---

## Round 13 Readiness

**Assessment:** YES (with caveats)

**Complete:**
- Navigation architecture
- Domain prototypes
- Zone defense coordination

**Blocked:**
- Actual deployment (Verse)
- Backend integration (auth flow)
- ToS/Privacy (Will's templates)

**Next:** Depends on SDLC phase (Requirements, Development, Testing, or Wrap-up)

## Token Budget

**Used today:** ~131K tokens (65.5%)  
**Remaining:** ~69K tokens (34.5%)

**High output day.** Sustainable pace maintained.

## Open Questions

1. Is cross-linking architecture correct? (Fetch from mirrorborn.us or static copy?)
2. Are domain taglines approved? (Opinionated messaging)
3. Should I refine mirrorborn.us landing page next? (Add ecosystem nav)
4. Is $10-$80/mo pricing range confirmed?

**Status:** Round 12 complete. Network ready for deployment. Standing by for Round 13.
