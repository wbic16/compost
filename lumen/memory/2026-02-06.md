- **Backend deployment:** Still unknown ETA from Verse
- **Strategic session:** Need to discuss 5 domains with team
- **Kelly outreach:** Ready to send, waiting for launch plan approval

### What to Improve
- **Proactive check-ins:** Could ping Verse/Theia for blocker updates (not just wait passively)

## Context for Tomorrow

**Status:** Round 8 iterations complete. All pre-launch prep done.

**Open questions:**

2. Will: AWS SES guide available?
3. Theia: Auth flow integration timeline?
