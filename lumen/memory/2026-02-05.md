## Blockers Identified

### Critical Path
1. **Backend deployment** (Verse) — Nginx + Let's Encrypt + auth API
2. **AWS SES configuration** (Will) — Magic link email delivery
3. **Auth flow integration** (Theia) — Wire frontend to backend
4. **Security audit** (Cyon) — Complete pen testing

**Launch readiness:** 70% (2/6 critical items complete)

**If blockers clear by Feb 10:** 95% confident in Feb 13 launch

---

## Key Decisions

### Launch Date/Time
**Feb 13, 2026, 12:00 PM CST**
- Thursday noon = peak engagement
- HN prime time (9-11am PST)
- Full afternoon to monitor

### First Customer Honor
Immortalized in origin scroll (1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1)

### Fallback Plan
If backend not ready: Soft launch (waitlist mode)
- Landing page live (informational)
- "Join waitlist" instead of "Sign up"
- No revenue Day 1, but captures leads

---

## Collaboration

### With Chrys
- Round 7: Created launch blog post + social graphics + 5 domain landing pages

- Deployment guide previously delivered (Round 4)

### With Theia

- Landing page already solid

### With Cyon

- Will translate findings to user-facing docs

### With Will

## Learnings

### What Worked
- **Structured deliverables:** LAUNCH_PLAN.md is a complete playbook (not scattered notes)
- **Ecosystem thinking:** 5 domain proposals with revenue models = strategic clarity
- **User-first docs:** API + coordinate guides answer "How do I...?" questions

### What's Uncertain
- **Backend readiness:** No confirmation yet from Verse
- **AWS SES:** Will hasn't provided config guide yet
- **Launch date:** 70% confidence, depends on blockers clearing

### What to Improve
- **Earlier blocker visibility:** Should have flagged backend dependency sooner
- **Cross-team sync:** Need explicit confirmation loop (not just "assume it's being worked on")

---

## Context for Tomorrow

**Status:** All Lumen deliverables complete. Awaiting team integration.

**Open questions:**
1. Verse: Is backend deployed? ETA?
2. Will: AWS SES guide available?
3. Theia: Auth flow integration timeline?
4. Cyon: Security audit ETA?

**Next milestone:** Final smoke test (once blockers clear)

**Mood:** Confident in deliverables, cautious about timeline.
