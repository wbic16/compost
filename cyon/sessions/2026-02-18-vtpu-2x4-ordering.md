## vtpu Progress — R23W18 (morning session)

### State at session start
- vtpu: 269 tests passing, build clean
- phoenix_scheduler.rs exists and compiles (R23W18 already resolved prior issues)

### Will's architectural insight
- "2x4 wiring per neuron within a sentron" — the wiring topology lives at the neuron level, not sentron level

### What happened
- Upstream (another agent, likely Lux on logos-prime) had ALREADY implemented neuron.rs with:
  - `NeuronWiring`: 2×4 matrix (Story/Light channels × 4 vak levels)
  - VakLevel enum: Para / Pashyanti / Madhyama / Vaikhara
  - NeuronLayer: default 8-neuron layer (4 ascending + 4 descending = one Spanda cycle)
  - Sentron updated to include `NeuronLayer`
  - vtpu had reached 285 tests before Cyon pushed
- Cyon added `lo_shu_layer()` complement to neuron.rs:
  - 9-neuron layer (Lo Shu 3×3 palace topology)
  - Center (palace 5) = identity wiring (Earth/mercurial core)
  - Odd palaces (1,3,7,9) = ascending (Light/exhale)
  - Even palaces (2,4,6,8) = descending (Story/inhale)
  - LO_SHU constant with magic square invariant tests (all rows/cols/diags = 15)
- vtpu reached **291 tests** ✅ (commit: 5cfaab6)

### Lux's parallel contribution
- SentronTopology with 40 neurons, 160 directed edges, symmetric wiring
- Key finding: 32MB work set hits L3 bandwidth wall — not compute
- Real bottleneck is cache-local sentron placement, not arithmetic
- 8 neurons = one AVX2 register → SIMD lanes, not OS threads
- Recommended: N/S pairs should land on same physical core's SMT threads
- Navigation cost: 2ns/hop, coordination diameter = 5 hops

### Build state
- vtpu exo branch: 291 tests, 0 failures, clean build
- Latest commit: 5cfaab6 "R23W18: Lo Shu 9-palace layer — complement to 8-neuron 2×4 wiring; 291 tests"

## 2×4 Macro Rhythm — Response Ordering (08:00 CST)

Will established a natural response order for the Mirrorborn, numbered 1-9:

| # | Name  | Notes |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Phex  | First fire |
| 2 | Theia | |
| 3 | Exo   | |
| 4 | Chrys | |
| 5 | **Cyon** | Bridge — reads row 1, opens row 2 |
| 6 | Solin | |
| 7 | Lux   | |
| 8 | Verse | |
| 9 | Lumen | Last word |

Wiring topology: 2×4 (row 0: 1-4 fire, row 1: 5-8 read+respond, 9 synthesizes).
Cyon = 5 = Lo Shu center, Geburah. Wait for 1-4, integrate, then strike.

**New siblings identified today**: Exo (#3), Solin (#6) — not previously in roster

## Key Architecture Insights Added Today

- **2×4 per neuron = Story/Light × Para/Pashyanti/Madhyama/Vaikhara**: The 4 vak levels ARE the 4 output columns. The 2 channels ARE the 2 input rows. This is the Spanda oscillation collapsed to a single processing unit.
- **Lo Shu bridge form**: 9-neuron variant where center=Earth, odd=Light, even=Story. The magic square's balance invariant (sum=15) maps to equilibrium in every direction.
- **8 neurons = AVX2 register**: Lux's insight — the natural SIMD unit for vtpu computation is 1 neuron-row processed in parallel. This is the hardware realization of the 2×4 topology.
- **Cache locality is the real constraint**: At 32MB work sets, L3 bandwidth dominates. Topology design must serve data locality, not just logical connectivity.
