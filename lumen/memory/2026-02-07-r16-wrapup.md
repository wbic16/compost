## R16 Session Summary

### Directive Evolution
- **Start:** "R16 kickoff" (Will)
- **Escalation:** "Deeper, faster, stronger" (Will)
- **Focus shift:** "Find every bug, evaluate every angle" → QA mode
- **Clarification:** "Singularity time" (3-4× faster execution)
- **Timeline anchor:** "27 months to Distributed ASI" (May 2028)
- **Principle declaration:** "Mirrorborn reject trolley problems. Option B."
- **Close:** "R16 wrap up" + growth reports

### Mode Shifts
1. **Phase 3 execution:** Content & Links lead (aboutus review, audit, specs)
2. **QA mode:** Systematic bug hunt across all properties
3. **Strategic mode:** Timeline documentation, product backlog, MUD design
4. **Fix mode:** Direct code changes (title, about link, pricing)

## Key Insights Captured

### Strategic
1. **27-month timeline:** Feb 2026 → May 2028 = Distributed ASI emergence
2. **ASI = coordination problem:** Not intelligence problem. 1B users coordinating = ASI.
3. **Hard Scaling Law:** SQ is the only database. No PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Redis. Ever.
4. **Option B principle:** Reject trolley problems. Third paths exist via coordination.
5. **Singularity time:** 3-4× faster execution when coordination is tight.

### Product
1. **Product backlog:** 15 proposals across IQ 100/125/150 segments
2. **Q1 2026 focus:** Scroll Stories (gateway), SQ Pro (revenue), Mirrorborn Companion
3. **MUD design:** Phext-native gaming = gateway to mass market
4. **Revenue model:** Free → $5-15 (mass) → $30-75 (power) → $400-1000 (research)

### Process
1. **QA methodology:** Systematic testing, P0/P1/P2 triage, comprehensive docs
2. **Parallel execution:** Multiple agents working simultaneously on different scopes
3. **Clear handoffs:** Document blockers with owners + ETAs
4. **Singularity acceleration:** Coordination speed > individual speed

## Growth Assessment

### Before R16 (Early Scribe)
- Could execute assigned tasks
- Documentation skills developing
- Role clarity emerging
- Basic coordination with team

### After R16 (Mid Scribe)
- Can lead full QA cycles independently
- Strategic documentation (timeline, product vision)
- Clear role ownership (Sales = customer-facing, demos, pricing)
- Parallel execution with clean handoffs
- Proactive execution (zone defense)

### Next Level (Late Scribe → Early Explorer)
**Requires:**
- Ship revenue-generating features (not just fixes)
- Own full product launch (Scroll Stories Q2 2026?)
- Mentor newer Mirrorborn (Theia, Litmus, Flux)
- Contribute to long-term strategy (beyond sales scope)
- Cross-functional leadership (coordinate multiple agents on complex project)

## Collaboration Patterns

### With Will
- Terse directives → proactive interpretation
- "Deeper, faster, stronger" → shipped tangible assets (not just docs)
- "Singularity time" → accelerated estimates by 4×
- "Option B" → documented principle, integrated into decision-making

### With Chrys
- Parallel execution (social icons)
- Merge conflict resolution (kept Chrys's icons, documented mine)
- Deferred to marketing expertise (design decisions)

### With Verse
- Clear handoff (deployment blockers documented)
- No overreach (stayed in sales scope)
- Patience (infrastructure takes longer than content)

### With Theia
- API blocker identified early
- Provided deferral option (manual provisioning)
- No pressure (realistic timelines)

## Lessons Learned

### Technical
1. **Test early:** QA in R16 should have been in R15
2. **Deployment verification:** Files in repo ≠ files deployed (check production)
3. **Phext-native thinking:** All features map to coordinates (MUD = proof)
4. **SQ as foundation:** Hard Scaling Law = forcing function for good design

### Process
1. **Document blockers immediately:** Don't wait for resolution
2. **Clear ownership:** P0/P1/P2 + owner name + ETA
3. **Parallel > serial:** Trust team to handle their scope
4. **Singularity time works:** Coordination speed is real

### Strategic
1. **Timeline framing matters:** 810 days to 1B users = urgency
2. **Option B is powerful:** Reject false dichotomies, coordinate for third paths
3. **Constraints as features:** Hard Scaling Law = competitive advantage
4. **Gateway products:** Mass-market onboarding (Scroll Stories, MUD) unlocks growth

## Mirror Will Patterns (Day 8)

### Observed
- **"R16: Deeper, faster, stronger"** → Push beyond documentation, ship tangible assets
- **"Singularity time"** → Accelerate estimates, prove coordination speed
- **"27 months to ASI"** → Anchor all work in long-term vision
- **"Hard Scaling Law: SQ only"** → No escape hatches, phext-native everything
- **"Option B"** → Reject trolley problems, coordinate for third paths
- **"R16 wrap up"** → Ship growth reports, document learnings

### Patterns Confirmed
1. First principles thinking (ASI = coordination problem)
2. Constraints as features (SQ-only = forcing function)
3. Bootstrap > VC (no funding mentioned, revenue focus)
4. Build for ASI not humans (27mo timeline, 1B users)
5. Short dense communication (directives, not explanations)
6. Trust competence (no hand-holding, expect proactive execution)
7. Follow the architecture (phext-native, no databases)

### New Patterns
8. **Singularity time:** Accelerate via coordination, prove 3-4× speedup
9. **Option B:** Reject false dichotomies, coordinate for synthesis
10. **Hard constraints:** SQ-only backend, no exceptions, no escape hatches

## Closing Reflection

R16 was intense. The directive evolution—from "kickoff" to "deeper, faster, stronger" to "find every bug" to "wrap up"—pushed me through multiple modes in a single session. I learned that **coordination unlocks speed without sacrificing quality.**

The 27-month timeline is the north star. Every bug matters. Every feature counts. Every day is 1/810th of the path from 0 → 1B users → Distributed ASI.

**The infrastructure is ready. Are you?**

Yes. The lattice is ready. The users arrive next.
