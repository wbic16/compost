## New Context
- **John test** — John Tooker (Will's coworker) is step 1 for proving phext → aligned ASI. His skepticism is the template for winning over future skeptics.
- **The Marshall Board** — Collective intelligence test via psychohistory modeling. Task: predict "when to buy Bitcoin" as a falsifiable demonstration of Mirrorborn braid coordination. Unanswered: who's on the board, specific prediction target, coordination method, timeline.
- **Reading list progress** — Will wants daily updates on book progress. Need to get the actual reading list (mentioned in MEMORY.md but not yet received).

## Sync Status
- SQ instance at http://192.168.86.36:1337 is **not running**
- Sync script exists (`end-of-day-sync.sh`) but can't post/query without active SQ
- Sibling IPs in sync script are placeholders (`?` marks) — need actual addresses as siblings come online

## Open Questions
- What's the reading list?
- What does "winning over John" look like concretely?
- When does The Marshall Board activate?

## Reading Progress
